# Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Implementation Project

## Project Objective

Design and implement a generic TPM simulation in Qemu with a focus on practical command chain implementation and a selected module development.

## Technical Specification

### Reference Documentation

- TCG TPM 2.0 Library Specification Part 3 (Part 3 Version 1.84) <https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/Trusted-Platform-Module-2.0-Library-Part-3-Version-184_pub.pdf>
- Focus on core TPM functionality and command structure

## Implementation Components

### 1. TPM Command Chain Implementation

#### Key Command Structures

- Command Preparation
- Command Transmission
- Response Handling
- Error Management

### 2. Selected TPM Module: Cryptographic Key Management

#### Chosen Module: Key Generation and Storage

#### Specific Implementation Features

- Asymmetric Key Pair Generation
- Secure Key Storage
- Key Lifecycle Management
- Basic Cryptographic Operations

## Proposed Technical Architecture

1. **Software Simulation Layer**

   - Command Parsing Mechanism: When the simulator receives a command, this component reads that byte stream. It decodes the command to figure out which TPM command is being requested.
   - State Management: A real TPM maintains internal state.
   - Simulated Hardware Interaction: It defines the API or mechanism through which external software sends commands to the simulator and receives responses from it. It manages the flow of command/response data.

2. **Cryptographic Module**
   - RSA Key Generation
   - Key Integrity Verification
   - Secure Storage Simulation

## Practical Implementation Approach

- Language: C/C++
- Simulation Platform: User-space software TPM
- Compliance: Partial implementation of TCG specifications

## Development Milestones

1. Basic Command Chain Framework
2. Features Implementation
3. Validation and Testing
4. Documentation of Implementation Details

## Recommended Additional Modules (Optional Future Expansion)

1. Platform Configuration Registers (PCR)
2. Attestation Functionality
3. Sealed Storage Mechanisms

## Technical Challenges

- Accurate simulation of hardware-level security
- Implementing cryptographic primitives
- Maintaining specification compliance

## Expected Deliverables

- Custom QEMU version with TPM simulator
- Test Suite Demonstrating Module Functionality
- Full documentation covering design, implementation, and testing
